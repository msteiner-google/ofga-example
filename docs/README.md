The documentation provided is divided in 3 sections.

Firstly, there is a page with a very brief summary of Fine-Grained ACL's and Google approach
to the topic. Link [here](<./Fine grained acls and Zanzibar.md>).

Secondly, I spent some time highlighting why you shouldn't _roll your own_ ACL system. Link [here](<./Don't roll your own.md>)

Lastly, there is a bit of an in-depth explanation of the model I picked for this example.
One for [unstructured documents](<./Authorization model for documents.md>) and one
for [tabular data](<./Authorization model for tabular data.md>).
I want to re-iterate that while the data they cover is bogus, the approaches are solid and
well thought out. You should definitely consider building from them.
